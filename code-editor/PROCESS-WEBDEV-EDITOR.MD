- **Content Security Policy**: Prevent XSS attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: Clean user input before rendering
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of public APIs

### Implementation Architecture for GitHub Pages

Since GitHub Pages only serves static content, all functionality must be implemented client-side:

1. **Frontend Framework**: Use a lightweight framework like Preact or vanilla JavaScript
2. **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor (VS Code's engine) or CodeMirror, loaded from CDN
3. **State Management**: Use browser's localStorage or IndexedDB for persistence
4. **File System**: Implement a virtual file system in the browser
5. **Preprocessors**: Client-side compilers (sass.js, Babel Standalone)
6. **External Resources**: Load from CDN (unpkg, jsdelivr, etc.)
7. **Sharing**: Encode project data in URL or use GitHub Gists as storage

### Key Implementation Considerations for GitHub Pages

1. **No Server-Side Processing**: All compilation and processing must happen in the browser
2. **Storage Limitations**: Use localStorage for small projects, IndexedDB for larger ones
3. **Performance**: Optimize for client-side processing with Web Workers
4. **Security**: Implement proper sandboxing for user code execution
5. **Offline Capability**: Use service workers for offline functionality
6. **URL Length Limits**: For sharing, use compression or GitHub Gists for large projects
